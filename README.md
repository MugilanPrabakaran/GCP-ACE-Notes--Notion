# GCP ACE Notes — Notion & Sketches

This repository contains study notes, sketches, and Q&A curated for the Google Cloud Certified — Associate Cloud Engineer (GCP ACE) exam. The content is a companion to Notion pages and personal sketches to help learners review key concepts, commands, and practice questions.

## Contents

- notes/ — Organized markdown study notes by topic (Compute, Storage, Networking, IAM, Security, Monitoring, etc.)
- sketches/ — Diagrams and sketches that illustrate architecture patterns and service interactions (PNG, SVG, or drawn images)
- q-and-a/ — Common exam-style questions and short answers to practice recall
- practice-tests/ — Sample practice tests and answers (if available)
- resources/ — External links, official docs, and recommended reading

## How to use

1. Browse the folders above and open the topics you want to review.
2. Use sketches/ to quickly visualize architecture and service interactions.
3. Practice with q-and-a/ and practice-tests/ to check timing and recall.
4. Consult resources/ for links to the official GCP documentation, quick reference guides, and hands-on labs.

## Study tips

- Focus on core services: Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, VPC, IAM, Cloud Logging and Monitoring, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, and Deployment Manager.
- Practice using gcloud CLI and the Cloud Console — the exam often tests practical tasks.
- Timebox practice tests to simulate exam conditions.
- Review IAM principals, roles, and best practices for least privilege.
- Understand networking basics: subnets, routes, firewall rules, VPC peering, and Cloud NAT.
